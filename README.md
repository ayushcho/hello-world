# hello-world
hello-world is the most typed name by developers because they used to learn and test new things and hello-word is what comes first in mind.

As usual i forget to introduce the narrator i.e me. :)
hello peoples!
 I am ayush chopra, a crazy person who don't know how to express himself and very positive at some places where as nervous when get focused.Dirven by hardwork rather than smart work because i am in learning phase so believe that even smart work requires 
hardwork. so i will be editing this later as this is just for test purpose.
